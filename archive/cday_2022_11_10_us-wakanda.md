# Cassandra Day | Wakanda Forever

_An action-packed day of superhero events through group learning, sharing and fun!_

### Date

November 10, 2022

### Location

Bellevue, Santa Clara and Houston

## Overview

Calling all Apache Cassandra® heroes! Join us for a complimentary two-hour hands-on workshop to learn Cassandra application building skills. We’ll help you get skilled up quickly, and every participant will receive a voucher to take the Cassandra certification test at a later date.

Then we celebrate the return of in-person Cassandra meetups with speakers from top companies with lots of food/drink and time to network. And let’s have some fun with t-shirts and prizes!

Finally we will end the day with an exclusive private screening of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (hours before the world premier) — a Cassandra appreciation event sponsored by DataStax and Intel! It’s a perfect opportunity to flex on your friends your superhero status with this early access event!

Please note that you must attend the Cassandra Day hands-on workshop and/or meetup in order to receive a movie ticket and popcorn/soda vouchers for you and your guest.

Don’t wait - we expect this event to “sell out” quickly. Pick your location in our event registration drop down: **Santa Clara, CA, Bellevue, WA or Houston, TX**. Event venue details will be shared in the confirmation email.
