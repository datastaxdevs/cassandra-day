## Overview

What do companies like Apple, Netflix, Huawei and Instagram have in common? Aside from billions of requests, petabytes of data, and millions of users around the world, all of these companies use Apache Cassandra™.

[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
